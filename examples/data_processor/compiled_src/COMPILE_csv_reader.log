Compilation Log for csv_reader
============================================================

Module Specification:
------------------------------------------------------------
Name: csv_reader
Purpose: Read CSV file and return data as list of dictionaries.
    
Takes a file path and returns parsed CSV data.
Each row becomes a dictionary with column names as keys.
Handles missing values by setting them to None.
Raises FileNotFoundError if file doesn't exist.
Raises ValueError if CSV is malformed.

Tests: 1 test cases
Dependencies: []

Prompt Sent to Claude:
------------------------------------------------------------
You are tasked with implementing a python module.

Module Specification:
---
Name: csv_reader
Purpose: Read CSV file and return data as list of dictionaries.
    
Takes a file path and returns parsed CSV data.
Each row becomes a dictionary with column names as keys.
Handles missing values by setting them to None.
Raises FileNotFoundError if file doesn't exist.
Raises ValueError if CSV is malformed.

Tests (your code must pass these):

Test 1: Read valid CSV
  Inputs: {'filepath': 'test_data.csv'}
  Expected Outputs: {'data': [{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'NYC'}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'city': 'SF'}]}
---

Your task:
1. Write the implementation to csv_reader.py
2. Write pytest tests to test_csv_reader.py that verify ALL the test cases above
3. Run the tests with pytest until they all pass
4. FAIL FAST: Let errors surface immediately. Do NOT add try-except blocks or default values unless explicitly specified in the purpose
5. Use clear variable names and type hints

Work iteratively - write code, run tests, fix failures, repeat until all tests pass.


Claude's Response:
------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect! The module is complete and all tests pass. 

## Summary

The CSV reader module has been successfully implemented with:

1. **csv_reader.py** - Implementation that:
   - Reads CSV files and returns data as list of dictionaries
   - Each row becomes a dictionary with column names as keys
   - Handles missing values by setting them to None
   - Raises FileNotFoundError if file doesn't exist
   - Raises ValueError if CSV is malformed
   - Includes type inference to convert numeric strings to int/float

2. **test_csv_reader.py** - Comprehensive pytest test suite covering:
   - ✅ Reading valid CSV (matches the specified test case)
   - ✅ File not found error handling
   - ✅ Missing values converted to None
   - ✅ Malformed CSV detection
   - ✅ Empty CSV with headers

All 5 tests pass successfully.
